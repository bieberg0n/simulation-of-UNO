# UNO-game

The simulation.py file was written in most basic python, using to show how 4 robots will play UNO game.

The client.py and server.py show how I try to make a usable uno game. It is just begining.

(2019/09/09) This time I add so much code into the servier.py adn client.py. I believe that my logic is complete but my programming skill is really bad. The biggest bug is that client will produce content unstoppable, but will not print anything.

(2019/09/10) After stupid test I decided to get pull request from my friend, which splits the message-showing feature and game-playing feature.
